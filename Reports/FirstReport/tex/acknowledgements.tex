This study was conducted to assess stocks of bigeye, yellowfin tunas and swordfish in the territorial and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Tanzania. We used length-based approach that is capable to estimate stocks from poor-fishery data. The study found that the stock of yellowfin and bigeye tuna in the territorial waters are underexploited but swordfish and yellowfin in EEZ are overexploited. Furthermore, swordfish and yellowfin and bigeye tuna are caught before attaining maturity. The onset of maturity for yellowfin and bigeye in the territorial waters occurs during the southeast monsoon season, a period that is predominated with juvenile both in Tanga and Mtwara. The study call for management of swordfish and yellowfin tuna in the EEZ and continual collection of fisheries data that will  help in sustainable management of tuna and tuna like species.
