# Tanzania
## Background
Tanzania\index{Tanzania} is well endowed with natural resources in terms of fisheries\index{fisheries} potential such as lakes, dams, rivers, several wetlands and marine waters (figure 1). It has a coastline of 1,424 km along the coast of Indian Ocean [@julius] and it share Lake Victoria with countries like Kenya and Uganda with Tanzania having 51% of the lake equivalent to km235,088) Lake Tanganyika with Congo Republic, Burundi and Zambia and Tanzania having 41% equivalent to km2 13,489 and Lake Nyasa shared with Malawi and Mozambique and Tanzania having 18.51% equivalent to km2 5,700. Also it has a territorial sea of about 64,000 km2 along the coast of Indian Ocean and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of about 223,000 km2. Therefore, the total water coverage is 346,337 km2 which is equivalent to 36.7% of 945,000 km 2 of the total land area.

The fisheries potential from all water bodies is estimated at around 750,000 metric tons whereby 100,000 metric tons is from marine waters and 650,000 metric tons is from inland waters with exclusion of EEZ potential. Currently, the total harvesting potential is at an average of 450 metric tons per year which signifies a difference of 300 metric tons of allowable catch yet to be exploited. Also these potentialities have contributed to a total of 26,445 fish ponds and 408 fish cages with total production of 18,075.6 metric tons from aquaculture.

Therefore, for better utilization of the endowed natural resources, fisheries research which is an integral part of fisheries management is crucial for development of fisheries and aquaculture sectors. However, fisheries research in Tanzania is conducted mainly by the Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI) which was established through Act No. 6 of 1980. Other institutions that conduct fisheries research include Fisheries Education and Training Agency (FETA), Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), University of Dar es salaam (UDSM), Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS), University of Dodoma (UDOM), Non-governmental Organizations at national and international levels as well as individual researchers.

Implementation of the fisheries\index{fisheries} research activities is hampered by several constraints, which include shortage of scientists in some specialized disciplines (such as gear technology, taxonomy, social science, fisheries stock assessment and molecular biology); insufficient infrastructure (offices, laboratory facilities and research vessels) and inadequate research funds. In order to meet the objectives of the Ministry, the development of implementable and effective Research Agenda is important as it maps out the key areas whereby if well implemented the research results can hasten the sectors development objectives. Thus, the focus of current Research Agenda is particularly on aquatic ecosystem, sustainable capture fisheries, aquaculture growth, marketing and trade of fish and aquatic products and cross-cutting.

## Rationale
Responsible governance of fisheries is central for the realization of food security, poverty eradication, sustainable livelihood, economic growth, social development and ecosystem maintenance. In this context, the importance of research to address challenges of developing the industry can’t be over emphasized.

Fisheries research aims at providing scientific information and advice on fisheries management for sustainable development of the fisheries sector. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in 2018 contributed about 1.7% of the GDP with an annual growth rate of 9.2, mainly through capture fisheries and aquaculture. Currently, per capital fish supply depicts a declining trend over time due to increased post-harvest loss, population growth and export trade that takes away about one third of the total landings.

To increase landings from capture fishery and aquaculture\index{aquaculture} would entail resolving problems that have hampered fisheries development projections in the past. Research that address reduction of post-harvest losses, promotion of fish farming and exploitation of the existing potential in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) appear to be some of the possible immediate options for increased fish supply. The key objective of this research agenda is to address the current and emerging challenges in fisheries research and identify priority areas that require new scientific knowledge in the short and long term.


## Sustainable capture fishery
The capture fisheries in Tanzania country is divided into marine and inland water fisheries. With regards to marine waters, much of the fishing activities take place in the inshore waters. The exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is yet to be exploited due to a number of drawbacks including *lack of data and information*. 

On the other hand, inshore marine\index{marine} and inland water fisheries\index{fisheries} in the country face a number of challenges including overcapacity\index{overcapacity}, overfishing\index{overfishing}, IUU fishing and environmental degradation that threatens resources sustainability. Hence, this research priority aims at generating data and information which will help to inform effective policy and decision making process and effective ways of addressing the challenges. The main research areas under this are grouped into short and long term priorities:

i. Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing
i. Fish stock assessment of priority fisheries in all
water bodies
i. Fish Migration patterns such as Tuna and tuna like species in EEZ, Nile perch in lake Victoria and Lates Stappersi in Lake Tanganyika
i. Endangered and threatened species (ETP) in all water bodies
i. Monetary value of aquatic resources
i.The correlation between the existing fisheries and aquaculture curriculums and employment opportunities
i. Catch assessment and frame survey in all water bodies with priority on minor water bodies
i.Fish ecology and critical habitats focusing on breeding and nursery areas in major water bodies
i.Fishing gear technology, methods and crafts
i. Limnology and Oceanography in all water bodies in relation to catchment, anthropogenic activities
i. Ornamental fishery
i. Fish aggregation devices
i. Fisheries modelling – fishery specific modelling in priority fisheries


## climate change\index{climate change}
Disaster risks and climate change is a major challenge of the twenty-first century which is adding to existing stressors, such as over-exploitation, habitat degradation, invasive species, urban development, and pollution impacting ecosystem services. There is a need to understand the direction and consequences of the changing climate on fisheries and aquaculture resources to guide adaptation and mitigation strategies of affected populations. 

The main research areas under this are grouped into short and long term priorities:

i. Climate change on livelihoods
i. Climate change variability and vulnerability
i. Climate change and environmental impacts
i. Climate change resilience
i. Climate change effect on fish stocks
i. Aquatic environment pollution (acidification)
i. Sea/lake level change
i. Climate change on fisheries ecosystems
