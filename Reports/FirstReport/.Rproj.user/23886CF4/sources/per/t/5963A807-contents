# Policy and Legal Framework
Tanzania\index{Tanzania} has an extensive policy, legal and institutional framework related to management\index{management}, conservation\index{conservation} and exploitation\index{exploitation} of fisheries\index{fisheries} resources enshrined in the National Constitution, the fisheries Act and Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute Act as well as supporting local laws and by-laws. This chapter presents overview of Tanzanian policy, legal and institutional framework of relevance to fisheries sector.


## National Policies and Legal Framework
National Fisheries Research Agenda is not a standalone strategic management tool to guide, coordinate, monitor and review effectiveness of the implementation of research activities. It relates and ties closely with national legal frameworks.

### Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania (1977 as amended)
Given the supremacy of the State Constitution as the norm from which other laws derive their legitimacy, the United Republic of Tanzania Constitution is one of the laws that must be considered in dealing with natural resources  in the country.  This Law is the supreme law of the Sovereign United Republic of Tanzania which governs the area of mainland\index{mainland} Tanzania and the whole area of Zanzibar\index{Zanzibar} including its territorial\index{territorial} waters.  The Constitution provides for the fundamental right to protect natural resources under article 24 (1). 

### National Research and Development Policy (2010)
The policy in Sec 1.2.2 recognizes TAFIRI as one of the Public institutions in Tanzania mandated to carry out fisheries research. As such TAFIRI will play a major role in implementing this Research Agenda.

### The National Fisheries Policy 2015)
The National Fisheries Policy area 3.4, policy\index{policy} statement (ii) recognizes and promotes fisheries research by other institutions and dissemination and utilization of research finding.

### National Water Policy (2002)
The National Water Policy (2002) addresses issues related to water resources management, rural and urban water supply and sewage. The policy is relevant to the National Fisheries Research Agenda as it address the key issue that includes: accessibility to clean water, for both urban and rural inhabitants and management of aquatic systems and biodiversity.

### National Biotechnology Policy (2010)
The general objective of this policy is to ensure that Tanzania has the capacity and capability to capture the proven benefits arising from health, agriculture, industry and environmental applications of biotechnology while protecting and sustaining the safety of the community and the environment. Therefore the National Fisheries Research Agenda will implement issues related to industrial and environmental biotechnology.

### National Environmental Management Act (2004)
The Act recognizes management of fisheries resources in accordance with the provisions of the Fisheries Act, 2003. Management of these fisheries resources requires scientific research. The National Fisheries Research Agenda will provide the scientific information generated through research to help achieve management of fisheries resource as stated in sec 65 (1) of the Act.

### The Fisheries Act (2003)
The Act No. 22 of 2003, Sec 53.-(1) empowers director in collaboration with research institutions and other stakeholders to outline areas that require research for fisheries and aquaculture management and development. This has been followed through the formulation process of this current research Agenda.

### Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute Act (2016)
Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute Act No. 11 of, 2016, identifies TAFIRI as a Parastatal body responsible for carrying fisheries and aquaculture research in all fresh and marine water bodies. The institute has been mandated to promote, conduct and coordinate research within and in relation to any part of the territorial waters or in relation to any part of the territory of the United Republic of Tanzania. Hence, they are the primary implementers of this Research Agenda.

### Deep Sea Fishing Authority Act (2007)
The Deep Sea fishing Authority (DSFA) is a corporate body established by the Act of Parliament No. 1.of 1998 and its Amendments of 2007 (Act No.4 of 2007). DSFA has a primary function among others to formulate and co-ordinate scientific research (Sec 4(4)(d) in the deep sea. They will therefore oversea that research\index{research} is carried out within the framework of this Research Agenda and that such information is availed for management.

### Marine Parks and Reserves Act (1994)
The Act in section 3(3)(a) mandates Marine Parks and reserves to manage these ecosystems. Management of these resources requires scientific research. The Research Agenda will help to provide the necessary information to inform management of the resources in marine parks and reserves.

## National, Regional and International Obligations Related to Fisheries

### National Integrated Coastal Environment Management Strategy (2003)
The strategy 5 in Section 4.2 of Strategies and Implementation Mechanisms describes development and use of coastal ecosystem research to allow available scientific and technical information to inform ICM decisions.

### Convention for the Protection, Management and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Eastern African Region (1996)
Contracting parties shall establish protected areas\index{protected areas} in areas under their jurisdiction\index{jurisdiction} with a view to safeguarding the natural resources of the Eastern African region and shall take all appropriate measures to protect those areas and shall take into account their importance as (a) Natural habitats, and in particular as critical\index{critical} habitats\index{habitats} for species of fauna and flora, especially those which are rare, threatened or endemic; (b) Migration\index{migration} routes or as wintering, staging\index{staging}, feeding\index{feeding} or molting\index{molting} sites for migratory species.

### AUC-NEPAD (2014). Policy Framework and Reform Strategy for Fisheries and Aquaculture in Africa
The Fisheries Sector Policy Framework and Reform Strategy provides framework and identifies strategic steps to be taken by member states for unlocking the full potential of fisheries and aquaculture for food security, livelihood\index{livelihood} and wealth creation of which fisheries research is among the tools.

### SADC Protocol on Fisheries (2011)
Article 17, of SADC protocol (2011) entails cooperation in establishing joint research programme and projects with particular reference to shared resources such as great lakes\index{lakes} and the marine\index{marine} waters.

### Conventional on Biological Diversity (1992)
Tanzania is adhering to Conventional on Biological Diversity (CBD) which was signed on 12th June, 1992 and ratified it on 08th March, 1996 in relation to endangered aquatic species.

### Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (1971)
The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (1971) is an intergovernmental treaty that embodies the commitments of its member countries to maintain the ecological character of their wetlands of international importance and to plan for the "wise use", or sustainable use, of all of the wetlands in their territories. Some of the areas that the Research Agenda identified wetlands of which their ecological characteristic should be monitored hence, this Research Agenda is a direct link to the Ramsar Convention


### FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing
This Code sets out principles and international standards of behavior for responsible practices with a view to ensuring the effective conservation, management and development of living aquatic resources, with due respect for the ecosystem and biodiversity. States and all those involved in fisheries are encouraged to apply the Code and give effect to it. Research is an integral part in providing information required to shape behavior envisaged in the Code of Conduct.

### Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
Aims at ensuring that international trade in specimen of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild and it accords varying degrees of protection to the available species of animals and plants.
